Questions:

Should we show self rported usage of WEs (50% of students claimed to read the Worked example at least most of the time) 
	Instead of/addition to measure usage
	% of most of the time is about the same as average measured usage, so one or the other is probably enough

How should we display helpfulness data
	~70% of students without prior experience found the examples helpful
	Only ~12% w/o prior chose disagree
	Map it to binary decision like Prior and comfort? 
	Something wrong with the tidying, ExampleWasHelpful occasionally has NaN as a value 

Cleaner way of displaying WE Use X Prior Exp vs Runs/TOT? 

On WE correlation to increased runs/tot
	While Using WE increased avg runs ~3x for students regardless of prior (by comfort: 3x for uncomfortable, 2x for comfortable), 
	#runs and TOT is drasitcally lower in noWE compared to F17. Could support conclusion of #runs causing WE use
