Problem/Motivation
	Are worked examples an effective way to strengthen knowledge and alleviate feelings of confusion?
		We want to see if providing worked examples that are similar to questions that commonly cause confusion makes students better able to solve the trouble questions and more importantly, better able to apply the concepts in general. 
	Questions
		How do students take advantage of examples(Tracking data, survey)
		Why do they use WEs (Survey)
		Do WEs improve knowledge (Time on task analysis)
		DO WEs help students get started (Survey)

            Also, examples should be presented in close proximity to matched practice problems.

        Analyzed data from the previous semester that had no worked examples 
        
	
Approach and Uniqueness
	Creation
		Determined what problems seemed to be the most difficult for students in the previous semester as well as new problems this semester that may cause confusion. 
		Made WEs that had similar format and used the same concepts as the trouble problems
		Added links to WE on the relevant trouble problem
	Evaluation
		Measured difficulty of the trouble questions this semester using same metric
		Tracked interaction with select WEs to gauge how often they were viewed and to what extent
		Took student survey on effectiveness and usage of WE
