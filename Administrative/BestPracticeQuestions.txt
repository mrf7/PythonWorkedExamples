How similar should worked examples be to trouble problems? 
Should WEs focus on questions with conceptual confusion or problems with wording confusion, or both?
	More importantly, which situation do WEs help more?
How broken up should steps be? 
How do we know if a WE or restructuring the problem is the right solution to a trouble problem?
Should/Can the WE be interactive? 
	i.e. Instead of a simple written out solution, have students actively engage with the WE.
