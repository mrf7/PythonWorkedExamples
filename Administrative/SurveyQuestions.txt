1. Are you aware of the worked examples for this course? 
How accessible were the worked examples in the way provided them

2. When a worked example was available for a problem, how often did you read it? 
	Never	Once/Twice	Sometimes	Usually		Every Time
For the students that were aware of the WEs, how likely were they to consciously read them?

3. For problems with a WE linked, I usually read the WE:
	Once I see it before trying to solve the problem
	Once I got stuck trying to solve the problem
	Before starting the problem when I am lost on how to start (wording?) 
	N/A
Partially duplicates 4, but also could provide some useful info on when students decide they should read the WE. 

4. If/When you read the WEs, why did you usually open them?
	Because it was there 
	Because I was confused about what the problem was asking
	Because I was confused about how to solve the problem 
	Because my answer to the problem wasn't working and I didn't know why
	Other:
Determines motivation for reading WE. Could allow tailoring examples to better help the students that actually use them

5. After reading the worked example I usually:
	Understood the concept better
	Understood the question better
	Understood how to get started better 
	Felt I had wasted my time
	Other?
Shows to what extent the examples helped. May want to allow students to select multiple 

6. Overall, how helpful were the worked examples for you (0 if never read)
	0-7
Shows overall usefullness of the worked examples
