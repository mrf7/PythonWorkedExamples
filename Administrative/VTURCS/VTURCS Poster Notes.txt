Problem 
	Enrollments in CS Classes are Increasing and Many Departments Can't keep up [NAS]

	
Hypothesis 
	Adding worked examples on difficult problems will improve understanding of both the problem and the concept 
Research Questions 
	Do WEs improve understanding
	Do students take advantage of WEs 
	Do students find WEs helpful

Prior Work
	[Morrison] B Morrison Subgoal Labels 
		Tried to determine if giving students subgoal labels is better 
		Performance gains were not significant 
	This vs Prior 
		This specificially tries to see if completion on targeted difficult problems can be improved by including a relevant worked example
	Find people that have cited Briana
	
Ed theory  
	Worked Examples[Renkl][Sweller]
		[Renkl] Suggests "Worked-examples are designed to support initial acquisition of cognitive skills"
	Example-Problem Pairs [Skudder]

Context 
	Python class
	demographics 
	
Methodology/Experiment design 
	Baseline F17 vs Experimental S18
	Show some WE 
	Maybe example of a problem they were given 
	Explain enviroment worked in (Blockpy)
	
Data COllection
	Survey data
	Programmatic method of collection

Results will likely be on last row 
	Graphs/ Tables 
	Statistics etc 
Conclusions
	take results and tell what we learned 
	Possibly 
	
Future Work 
	Have 2 good things ready to discuss when asked
		Interactive WEs 
		More Concise WEs with only subgoal labels, not as much description
		Other strategies to better reach students in classes with high enrollment
